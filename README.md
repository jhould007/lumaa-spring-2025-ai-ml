## Dataset
<b>Dataset Chosen:</b> [Movies dataset details | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar62/movies-details) <br>
<b>Description from Kaggle Page:</b> "This dataset contains information on 8,551 movies, including titles, release dates, popularity scores, and user ratings. It features vote counts and average ratings, making it useful for analyzing top-rated films and audience preferences. The dataset also includes movie overviews, providing a brief summary of each film. Ideal for recommendation systems, trend analysis, and sentiment studies in the film industry."

Download this dataset and place the CSV file ("movies.csv") in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook file.

## Setup

My solution runs on Python 3.11.5, so you will need that version to run it. It may work on other versions, but using this one minimizes the chances that you'll have problems.

Download the Jupyter Notebook file, run the Jupyter Notebook program (install it if you do not have it yet), open the file in the web interface that shows up, then click Cell -> Run All to execute. 

The function to find recommendations takes two parameters: The user query, and the number of recommendations desired. In the call to the function at the bottom of the notebook, either or both of these can be edited at will for different output.

Here are a few potential queries:

`provide_recommendations("I like action movies set in space", 5)` <br>
`provide_recommendations("I love romcoms", 3)` <br>
`provide_recommendations("I'm a big fan of murder mysteries", 4)` <br>

## Results

<b>Function Call:</b> `provide_recommendations("I like action movies set in space", 5)`
